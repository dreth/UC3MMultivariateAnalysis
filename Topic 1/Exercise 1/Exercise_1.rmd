#### Importing the data

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(foreach)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(MASS)
library(andrews)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
d <- read.csv('../../datasets/Colleges.csv')
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
head(d)
```

## 1- Identify the type of all variables

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
foreach (col = d, nms = colnames(d)) %do% {
    print(str_interp("${nms} is of type ${typeof(col)}"))
}
```

#### represented as R type - numerical/categorical 

- X is of type character - categorical (id)
- Private is of type character - categorical binary
- Apps is of type integer - numerical discrete
- Accept is of type integer - numerical discrete
- Enroll is of type integer - numerical discrete
- Top10perc is of type integer - numerical discrete
- Top25perc is of type integer - numerical discrete

## 2- Perform a visual analysis of each quantitative variable. Then do so considering the variable *private*. Describe each plot.

### Histograms

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# setting plot sizes
options(repr.plot.width = 14, repr.plot.height = 8)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Apps
hist(d$Apps)
```

- Large right tail, higher frequency
- Long left tail
- Very right skewed
- Resembles gamma distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Accept
hist(d$Accept)
```

Pretty much the same as Apps but with a significantly shorter left tail. Probably because those students being accepted are just a subset of those that apply.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Enroll
hist(d$Enroll)
```

Enroll also tells the same story, but in this case our left tail is even smaller than the accept left tail. Maybe because significantly less students enroll than those that just get accepted

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Top10perc
hist(d$Top10perc)
```

- long left tail
- short but high frequency right tail
- Resembles gaussian distribution
- most elements concentrate around 20

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Top25perc
hist(d$Top25perc)
```

- mean is probably between 40-60
- small right tail
- large left tail
- Resembles gaussian distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# F.Undergrad
hist(d$F.Undergrad)
```

- long left tail
- most of the universities between 0-5000
- significantly less data at 5000+
- Resembles gamma distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# P.Undergrad
hist(d$P.Undergrad)
```

Similar to F.Undergrad we have a quite long right tail, this one resembles Apps more, and similar to F.Undergrad we also have a large frequency right tail and possibly more than 90% of the data between 0 and 5000

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Outstate
hist(d$Outstate)
```

- Mean around 10000
- relatively heavy left tail but not very long
- light right tail
- resembles gaussian distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Room.Board
hist(d$Room.Board)
```

- resembles a slightly right skewed gaussian distribution
- relatively long left tail
- mean between 3500-4500

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Books
hist(d$Books)
```

- long left tail
- very right skewed
- mean most probably around 500
- nearly all values between 400-750

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Personal
hist(d$Personal)
```

- very right skewed
- long left tail
- resembles a gamma distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# PhD
hist(d$PhD)
```

- long and light right tail
- very left skewed

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Terminal
hist(d$Terminal)
```

- very left skewed
- light and long right tail
- frequency increases with value (the higher the more common perhaps?)

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# S.F.Ratio
hist(d$S.F.Ratio)
```

- most values between 10-20
- light and long left tail
- light right tail
- resembles gaussian distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# perc.alumni
hist(d$perc.alumni)
```

- right skewed
- long and light left tail
- relatively flat around the highest frequency part

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Expend
hist(d$Expend)
```

- very right skewed
- very long left tail
- most values around 10000
- resembles gamma distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Grad.Rate
hist(d$Grad.Rate)
```

- quite resembles a gaussian distribution with mean between 50-70
- light leftmost bin frequency

### Boxplots

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# setting plot sizes
options(repr.plot.width = 18, repr.plot.height = 10)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# numeric columns
cols = colnames(d)[colnames(d) != 'X' & colnames(d) != 'Private']

# maximum per column
sapply(d %>% dplyr::select(cols), max, na.rm = TRUE)

# low val cols
low_val_c = c('Top10perc','Top25perc','PhD','Terminal','S.F.Ratio','perc.alumni','Grad.Rate')
low_val = melt(d, id.vars='X', measure.vars=low_val_c)

# med val cols
med_val_c = c('Enroll','Room.Board','Books','Personal')
med_val = melt(d, id.vars='X', measure.vars=med_val_c)

# high val cols
high_val_c = c('Apps','Accept','F.Undergrad','P.Undergrad','Outstate','Expend')
high_val = melt(d, id.vars='X', measure.vars=high_val_c)
```

#### Variables with low values (maximum under 120)

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
low_val %>%
    ggplot(aes(x="X", y=value)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(color=variable))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# quantiles
sapply(d %>% dplyr::select(low_val_c), quantile, na.rm = TRUE)

## 3- Perform a visual analysis of all quantitative variables together.  Then, Perform a visual analysis of each of the quantitative variables taking into account the variable Private.

### Correlation and scatterplots for all variables

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
pa <- d %>% dplyr::select(cols)
chart.Correlation(pa, histogram=TRUE, pch=19, method="pearson")
```

Here we can see a plot with all the numerical variables, a histogram and density plot in the main diagonal. To the bottom of the diagonal we see scatterplots for each pair of variables and a line that goes through the scatterplot. 
Above the main diagonal we see all the correlation coefficients for each pair of variables.

We see there are some highly correlated variables and some others which have negligible correlation.

All correlation coefficients are Pearson correlation coefficients.

The variables with the highest correlation are the following:

- F.Undergrad vs Enroll with very high correlation of 0.96
- Apps vs Accept with a similarly high correlation coefficient of 0.94
- Accept vs Enroll also have a very high correlation of 0.91
- Top10perc vs Top25perc have a correlation of 0.89
- F.Undergrad vs Accept have a correlation of 0.
- Both Apps vs Enroll and Phd vs Terminal have a correlation of 0.85

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# setting colors
color_1 <- "black"
color_2 <- "red"
colors <- as.numeric(as.factor(d$Private)) - 1
i <- 1
for (num in colors) {
    colors[i] = ifelse(num==1, color_1, color_2)
    i <- i + 1
}
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
pa <- d %>% dplyr::select(cols)
pairs(pa,pch=1,col=colors)
```

In most of these scatter plots we see an interesting pattern, where for varibles plotted versus Top10perc, Top20perc, PhD and Terminal there seems to be no clear divide between each one ofg the groups, except when compared to variables that significantly diffentiate both groups.

The clear differentiator variables seem to be P.Undergrad, F.Undergrad, S.F.Ratio, Apps, Accept, Enrool and outstate.

And sure, I could definitely agree that the size of each plot might be overestimating such division in groups, but some of these variables do show a stark difference in values.

### PCP

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
parcoord(pa,var.label=TRUE)
```

We can basically just see the spread of the data here, the only thing I take from it is that apps and accept have really very few outliers in terms of quantity, but they're significantly larger than the rest. Shows how skewed these variables are.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
parcoord(pa,var.label=TRUE, col=colors)
```

We can see that the more extreme variables of Apps, Accept, P.Undergrad, F.Undergrad seem to be affected by whether it's private or not.

In the case of outstate too, but instead of being the highest values, the values where it's private correspond to the lowest values.

For Grad.Rate it also seem somewhat divided and in a similar way for perc.alumni.

For Top10perc, Top25perc, PhD or Terminal there seems to be no noticeable difference made by whether it's private or not.

#### Randomizing the order of the variables we get a different but perhaps better PCP.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
cols <- sample(cols)
pa <- pa %>% dplyr::select(cols)
parcoord(pa,var.label=TRUE, col=colors)
```

Here we can more clearly see that for S.F.Ratio there is a stark difference between both groups, where the group labeled as Private seems to have the higher values.

For the rest of the variables we get much of the same we explained earlier.

#### If we were to line up variables with similarly shaped histograms, we could get an interesting PCP, let's try that.

We will exclude Top10perc and Top25perc as these do not contribute too much to the plot

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# right skewed variables
right_skewed <- c('Apps','Accept','P.Undergrad','F.Undergrad','Personal','Expend','Books','perc.alumni')
right_skewed <- d %>% dplyr::select(right_skewed)

# normal-like variables
normal_like <- c('Outstate','Room.Board','perc.alumni','Grad.Rate','S.F.Ratio')
normal_like <- d %>% dplyr::select(normal_like)

# left skewed variables
left_skewed <- c('PhD','Terminal')
left_skewed <- d %>% dplyr::select(left_skewed)
```

#### right skewed variables PCP

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
parcoord(right_skewed,var.label=TRUE, col=colors)
```

After grouping similarly shaped variables the plots are somewhat clearer. Confirming most of our previous observations.

The general idea is that for these variables, pretty much everything but perc.alumni, Books and Expend follow a pattern where the higher-than-usual variables pretty much belong completely to entries of Private colleges.

#### normal-like variables PCP

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
parcoord(normal_like,var.label=TRUE, col=colors)
```

I particularly like this one. These variables look significantly clearer here than in the first PCP. 

The first observations still hold though. For pretty much all these variables there's a significant divide in the same direction except for S.F.Ratio where that pattern is inverted.

#### left skewed variables PCP

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
parcoord(left_skewed,var.label=TRUE, col=colors)
```

being private or not makes no difference here, therefore not very interesting.

### Andrews' plot

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
andrews(as.data.frame(cbind(pa,as.factor(d$Private))),clr=7,ymax=6)
```

The Andrews' plot makes it difficult to appreciate a significant difference between both groups in my opinion. Perhaps I might need to read up more on it but it doesn't show tell me too much about the values other than around the middle. Where the we have the 0 and around -2, where the groups seem more divided than everywhere else, taking different directions in the dataset.
