}{The COVID-19 dataset }}\label{the-covid-19-dataset}}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and
vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2. COVID-19 mainly spreads through the air when people are near each
other long enough, primarily via small droplets or aerosols, as an
infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. There are
currently no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19, though
several are in development.
