# Final project: Assignment 1

This is the first part of the final project for multivariate analysis made during my master's degree.

I have authored almost all the code in part 1 and lightly modified a few chunks of code from my classmates' [Danyu Zhang](https://github.com/danyuz) and [Limigrui Wan](https://github.com/juanliii) codes.

Part 2 was authored by [Limingrui Wan](https://github.com/juanliii), I have corrected some sentences in it and reorganized the pages and the writing along with the code blocks and most of the aesthetics of this part.

Part 3 was authored by [Danyu Zhang](https://github.com/danyuz), I have corrected some sentences and reorganized the pages, plot sizes and writing along with some of the aesthetics. The presentation of the content was made by Danyu as well.

High five to my partners for this project which have been amazing (:

Once they open a github account I will link their profiles on this markdown file.

Thanks for checking this out!
