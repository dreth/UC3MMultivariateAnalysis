# Final project: Assignment 1

This is the first part of the final project for multivariate analysis made during my master's degree.

I have authored almost all the code in part 1 and lightly modified a few chunks of code from my classmates' Danyu Zhang and Limigrui Wan codes.

Part 2 was authored by Limingrui Wan, I have corrected some sentences in it and reorganized the pages and the writing along with the code blocks and most of the aesthetics of this part.

Part 3 was authored by Danyu Zhang, I have corrected some sentences and reorganized the pages, plot sizes and writing along with some of the aesthetics.

High five to my partners for this project which have been amazing (:

Once they open a github account I will link their profiles on this markdown file.

Thanks for checking this out!
